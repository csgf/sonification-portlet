<h2>About the Sonification Application</h2>
<p align="justify">
 Data Sonification is the representation of data by means of sound signals, so it is the analog of scientific visualization, where we deal with auditory instead of visual images. Generally speaking any sonification procedure is a mathematical mapping from a certain data set (numbers, strings, images, ...) to a sound string.</br></br>

Data sonification is currently used in several fields, for different purposes: science and engineering, education and training, since it provides a quick and effective data analysis and interpretation tool. Although most data analysis techniques are exclusively visual in nature (i.e. are based on the possibility of looking at graphical representations), data presentation and exploration systems could benefit greatly from the addition of sonification capacities.
