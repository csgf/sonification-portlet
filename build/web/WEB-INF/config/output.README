This application allows Science Gateway users to implements the sonification of data 
by means of sound signals. 
Generally speaking any sonification procedure is a mathematical mapping from a certain 
data set (numbers, strings, images, ...) to a sound string.

If the job has been successfully executed, the following files will be produced:
~ Text2Midi.out:        the standard output file;
~ Text2Midi.err:        the standard error file;
~ message.mid:		the audio file produced during the sonification process.

- About the MIDI Toolbox
The MIDI Toolbox is a compilation of functions for analyzing and visualizing MIDI files in the Matlab computing environment. 
Besides simple manipulation and filtering functions, the toolbox contains cognitively inspired analytic techniques that are 
suitable for context-dependent musical analysis that deal with such topics as melodic contour, similarity, key-finding, 
meter-finding and segmentation.

This application allows Science Gateway users to implements the sonification of data 
by means of sound signals. 
Generally speaking any sonification procedure is a mathematical mapping from a certain 
data set (numbers, strings, images, ...) to a sound string.

If the job has been successfully executed, the following files will be produced:
~ Text2Midi.out: 	the standard output file;
~ Text2Midi.err: 	the standard error file;
~ Sonification.aiff: 	the audio file produced during the sonification process;
~ Sound.data:		an ASCII representation about the sonified audio file

- About the MIDI Toolbox
The MIDI Toolbox is a compilation of functions for analyzing and visualizing MIDI files in the Matlab computing environment. 
Besides simple manipulation and filtering functions, the toolbox contains cognitively inspired analytic techniques that are 
suitable for context-dependent musical analysis that deal with such topics as melodic contour, similarity, key-finding, 
meter-finding and segmentation.

- About the MIDI Toolbox
The MIDI Toolbox is a compilation of functions for analyzing and visualizing MIDI files in the Matlab computing environment. 
Besides simple manipulation and filtering functions, the toolbox contains cognitively inspired analytic techniques that are 
suitable for context-dependent musical analysis that deal with such topics as melodic contour, similarity, key-finding, 
meter-finding and segmentation.

This application allows Science Gateway users to implements the sonification of data 
by means of sound signals. 
Generally speaking any sonification procedure is a mathematical mapping from a certain 
data set (numbers, strings, images, ...) to a sound string.

If the job has been successfully executed, the following files will be produced:
~ Text2Midi.out:        the standard output file;
~ Text2Midi.err:        the standard error file;

- About the MIDI Toolbox
The MIDI Toolbox is a compilation of functions for analyzing and visualizing MIDI files in the Matlab computing environment. 
Besides simple manipulation and filtering functions, the toolbox contains cognitively inspired analytic techniques that are 
suitable for context-dependent musical analysis that deal with such topics as melodic contour, similarity, key-finding, 
meter-finding and segmentation.

This application allows Science Gateway users to implements the sonification of data 
by means of sound signals. 
Generally speaking any sonification procedure is a mathematical mapping from a certain 
data set (numbers, strings, images, ...) to a sound string.

If the job has been successfully executed, the following files will be produced:
~ Text2Midi.out:        the standard output file;
~ Text2Midi.err:        the standard error file;
~ message.mid:		the audio file produced during the sonification process.

- About the MIDI Toolbox
The MIDI Toolbox is a compilation of functions for analyzing and visualizing MIDI files in the Matlab computing environment. 
Besides simple manipulation and filtering functions, the toolbox contains cognitively inspired analytic techniques that are 
suitable for context-dependent musical analysis that deal with such topics as melodic contour, similarity, key-finding, 
meter-finding and segmentation.

This application allows Science Gateway users to implements the sonification of data 
by means of sound signals. 
Generally speaking any sonification procedure is a mathematical mapping from a certain 
data set (numbers, strings, images, ...) to a sound string.

If the job has been successfully executed, the following files will be produced:
~ Text2Midi.out:        the standard output file;
~ Text2Midi.err:        the standard error file;
~ TunguScore.mid:	the audio file produced during the sonification process;

This application allows Science Gateway users to implements the sonification of data 
by means of sound signals. 
Generally speaking any sonification procedure is a mathematical mapping from a certain 
data set (numbers, strings, images, ...) to a sound string.

If the job has been successfully executed, the following files will be produced:
~ Text2Midi.out: 	the standard output file;
~ Text2Midi.err: 	the standard error file;
~ Sonification.aiff: 	the audio file produced during the sonification process;
~ Sound.data:		an ASCII representation about the sonified audio file

- About the MIDI Toolbox
The MIDI Toolbox is a compilation of functions for analyzing and visualizing MIDI files in the Matlab computing environment. 
Besides simple manipulation and filtering functions, the toolbox contains cognitively inspired analytic techniques that are 
suitable for context-dependent musical analysis that deal with such topics as melodic contour, similarity, key-finding, 
meter-finding and segmentation.
